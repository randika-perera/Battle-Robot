# Battle Robot for EXMO 2023

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our battle robot showcased at EXMO 2023, hosted by the University of Moratuwa. This project was a thrilling endeavor undertaken by our dedicated team to demonstrate the power and ingenuity of robotics in a competitive setting.

## Overview

Our battle robot is a formidable creation, designed to impress and awe the audience with its two powerful weapons: a hammer with a sharp edge and a roller equipped with menacing spikes. The entire chassis of the robot is crafted from sturdy metal, ensuring durability and strength during intense combat.

## Components Used

To bring this impressive creation to life, we utilized a carefully selected array of components, including:

-   **Arduino Mega2560 Development Board**: The heart of our robot, providing the brains to control its movements and weapons with precision.
    
-   **HC05 Bluetooth Module**: For seamless wireless control, we integrated the HC05 Bluetooth module, offering ease of use and cost-effectiveness. Control of the robot was carried out using a smartphone app that can send serial data via Bluetooth.
    
-   **12.6V Li-Po Battery Packs**: To power our battle robot, we harnessed the energy of 12.6V Li-Po battery packs, ensuring high current discharge capability and long-lasting performance.
    
-   **Buck-Boost Converters**: These essential components allowed us to efficiently regulate and adjust the voltage for various parts of the robot.
    
-   **33kgcm Servo Motor**: For precise and dynamic hammer movements, we employed a high-torque 33kgcm servo motor.
    
-   **12V DC Motors**: The powerful 12V DC motors were used for navigation and for our roller weapon.
    
-   **Aptinex Motor Drivers**: These reliable motor drivers facilitated smooth and reliable control over the motors, optimizing their performance.
    
-   **Custom PCB**: To streamline our robot's electronics and ensure a clean setup, we designed a custom PCB tailored to our specific needs.
    
-   **Custom Metal Chassis**: The strong and sturdy metal chassis formed the foundation of our robot, providing the necessary support and protection.
    

## Code
