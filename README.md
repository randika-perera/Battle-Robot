# Battle Robot for EXMO 2023

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our battle robot showcased at EXMO 2023, hosted by the University of Moratuwa. This project was a thrilling endeavor undertaken by our dedicated team to demonstrate the power and ingenuity of robotics in a competitive setting.

## Overview

Our battle robot is a formidable creation, designed to impress and awe the audience with its two powerful weapons: a hammer with a sharp edge and a roller equipped with menacing spikes. The entire chassis of the robot is crafted from sturdy metal, ensuring durability and strength during intense combat.

## Components Used

To bring this impressive creation to life, we utilized a carefully selected array of components, including:

-   **Arduino Mega2560 Development Board**: The heart of our robot, providing the brains to control its movements and weapons with precision.
    
-   **NRF24 Module**: For seamless wireless control, we integrated the NRF24 module, offering ease of use and cost-effectiveness. Control of the robot was carried out using our custom designed controller.
    
-   **12.6V Li-Po Battery Packs**: To power our battle robot, we harnessed the energy of 12.6V Li-Po battery packs, ensuring high current discharge capability and long-lasting performance.
    
-   **Buck-Boost Converters**: These essential components allowed us to efficiently regulate and adjust the voltage for various parts of the robot.
    
-   **33kgcm Servo Motor**: For precise and dynamic hammer movements, we employed a high-torque 33kgcm servo motor.
    
-   **12V DC Motors**: The powerful 12V DC motors were used for navigation and for our roller weapon.
    
-   **Aptinex Motor Drivers**: These reliable motor drivers facilitated smooth and reliable control over the motors, optimizing their performance.
    
-   **Custom PCB**: To streamline our robot's electronics and ensure a clean setup, we designed a custom PCB tailored to our specific needs.
    
-   **Custom Metal Chassis**: The strong and sturdy metal chassis formed the foundation of our robot, providing the necessary support and protection.
    


## PCB Design

To ensure impeccable wiring organization and stability, we designed a custom PCBs using Altium Designer, streamlining the intricate connections.

## Enclosure Design

The enclosure for the battlebot was manufactured using sheet metal. 3D models for the enclosure were designed using Solidwork sheetmetal feature and generated DXF files were sent to the manufacturers.

## Code

For those curious about the magic behind the robot's movements and weapon control, we have provided the code used to program the Arduino Mega2560 in the 'code' folder of this repository. Feel free to explore and learn from our implementation!
